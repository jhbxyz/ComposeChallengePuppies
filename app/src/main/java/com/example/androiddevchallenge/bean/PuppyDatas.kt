    "Small, smart, and energetic, the Alaskan Klee Kai is a relatively new breed that looks like a smaller version of the Siberian Husky. Even the name “Klee Kai” comes from an Inuit term meaning “small dog.”\n\nWhile Alaskan Klee Kais may resemble larger Husky breeds, they have some key differences, especially when it comes to temperament, that distinguish it from its ancestor working class dogs of the north. This breed is more suited to the life of a companion; although, the Alaskan Klee Kai shares the high energy of the Husky and demands plenty of exercise.",
    "Clever, goofy, gentle, and loyal. Bernedoodle fans boast that this mixed breed has the best of both worlds from its Bernese Mountain Dog and Poodle parents.\n\nDespite their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you may find these dogs in the care of shelters and rescues. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if this is the mixed breed for you!",
    "Another sweet dog falls victim to an owner who no longer wants him. Yes, Sonny was actually headed to the shelter until his owner’s brother-in-law reached out to us for help. Now this handsome boy is safe with us as he dreams of a family who will love and cherish him forevermore. Sonny is quite an affable fellow and is comfortable with both people and other dogs. At 16 pounds, this young lad will be neutered, microchipped, and brought current on his vaccines as part of his adoption. So, what do you think? Might you be the family of Sonny’s dreams?",
    "8 year old Thor lost his home when his owner died and other family members were unable to keep him. Thor was a lived near Bradley Cooper and was friends with his dog, Charlie. He loves sunbathing in his yard and getting hugs from his people.\n" +

    "This 2 year-old is a small-time rottie who deserves a fighting chance at a great home!\n" +
